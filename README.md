# Google Advanced Data Analytics: Capstone Project

---

## Project Overview

This capstone project demonstrates the application of advanced data analytics skills to a real-world dataset. It serves as a final project for the “Google Advanced Data Analytics” course and walks through the entire data science lifecycle—right from data preprocessing to predictive modeling and insights extraction.

## Data & Inputs
- Preprocessing steps included:
  - Handling missing values
  - Normalizing features
  - Creating derived columns through feature engineering

---

## Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified key patterns and anomalies
- Visualized distributions and relationships using boxplots, histograms, and pairplots

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Constructed features based on statistical aggregations
- Used domain knowledge to build useful predictors

### 3. Clustering
- Performed unsupervised learning using **K-Means**
- Identified optimal `k` using elbow method and silhouette scores

### 4. Predictive Modeling
- Trained regression and/or classification models
- Evaluated performance using metrics like:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision / Recall
  - RMSE (for regression)

## Results & Key Takeaways

- Data successfully segmented into distinct clusters for targeted analysis
- Predictive models delivered actionable insights with acceptable performance
- Visualizations enhanced understanding and interpretability of results
